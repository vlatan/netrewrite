## Who is maintaining this little site?
I'm just an "ordinary" nerd who conducts research about the topics I like, I cherry-pick and combine tutorials scattered around the interwebz and I experiment a lot using my favourite method: trial and error.

## Why?
I am running a big, fat, somewhat popular website for nearly a decade and I've always wanted to document my experiments somewhere. So I gave birth to this small, tutorial-like, static website (made in Hugo and hosted on S3) where I note my endeavours for my own and your reference.

## The result
Every method, action, advice, and code on this website is tested and surprisingly it works… at least in my environment. Everything is very easy and straightforward, divided in logical sequences and topics.

So dive in.
