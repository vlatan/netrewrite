## Analytics

This site tracks and collects user's data via [Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/) in
an aggregated (not personally identifiable) way. The data includes page-views, age, gender, interests, language,
location, behaviour and technology being used. I track this information in order to understand the audience and
to improve the site.


## Affiliate links

I may be participant in an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for me to earn fees by
linking to the affiliated sites. This means that some of the links on this site may be "affiliate links". When
you click on one of those links, you will leave this site and land on an affiliate webpage. If you decide to
purchase an item from there, through our link, I will receive an affiliate commission. However, I only recommend
products that I believe are worth purchasing and will add value to the visitors.
